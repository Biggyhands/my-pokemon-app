# my-pokemon-app
This is a web application developed using React that allows users to search for Pokémon, view a list of at least 20 Pokémon, and explore specific details about each one. The application uses the PokeAPI to fetch data and includes features such as search, pagination, and detail views.

- **Pokémon Details:** Shows detailed information about each Pokémon, including name, image, abilities, and types.
- **Styling:** Responsive design with basic styling applied using CSS
- **Error Handling:** Basic error handling for cases where the API fails or returns no data.

**Technologies Used:**
- **HTML** Markup language for structuring the web page.
- **CSS** Style sheet language for designing the appearance of the web page.
